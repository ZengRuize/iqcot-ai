# Latest Summary

## Current Direction

The active research direction is:

```text
Bidirectional large-signal voltage regulation
+ PIS-IEK small-signal current-sharing / phase-recovery model
+ active-phase add/shed hybrid event management
+ AI/table supervisor with safety projection
```

External load-current slew is an observed disturbance descriptor, not an AI-controlled action.

## Baseline

All future validation starts from:

```text
E:/Desktop/codex/output/simulink_ideal_iqcot/four_phase_ideal_digital_iqcot.slx
```

The baseline exists locally and must not be modified directly.

## Worktree Reorganization

Current theory now lives under `docs/theory/`. Current validation protocol now lives under `docs/validation/`. Codex operating rules now live under `docs/codex/`.

Legacy documents were mirrored under `legacy/2026-06-legacy-docs/`. Untracked R049 temporary outputs were moved under `results/archive/2026-06-r049-untracked-output/`. Old paper drafts were moved under `papers/archive/2026-06-legacy-paper/`.

## Validation Status

E001 baseline wiring audit is complete:

```text
experiments/E001_baseline_audit/e001_baseline_wiring_audit.md
```

Result: the ideal IQCOT baseline behavior is usable as A0/B0/C0/D0 reference evidence, but E010 derived models must add observability for `Iload`, `Ton_actual_i`, and `active_phase_set`.

E010 load-drop evidence has been expanded:

```text
cases: 40A -> 20A, 40A -> 10A, 40A -> 1A
boundary check: 120A -> 10A
summary: experiments/E010_load_drop_overshoot/e010_research_summary.md
table: results/current/e010_research_table.csv
classification: MODEL_REVISED
```

Key metrics:

```text
A0 original:
  peak overshoot = 2.37866 mV
  recovery peak 2-12us = 2.36936 mV

A1 Ton truncation only:
  peak overshoot = 2.41604 mV
  recovery peak 2-12us = 2.14559 mV
  recovery delta vs A0 = -9.44%
  undershoot penalty = 0 mV

A2 Ton truncation + one early pulse inhibit:
  peak overshoot = 2.35886 mV
  recovery peak 2-12us = 1.84342 mV
  recovery delta vs A0 = -22.2%
  undershoot penalty = 0.863951 mV

A3 guarded reentry with reentry_band_down = 1.2 mV:
  pulse inhibit rejected by projection
  recovery peak 2-12us = 2.14559 mV
  undershoot penalty = 0 mV

A4 table-selected a_O under 1 mV undershoot budget:
  selected A2-like action
  recovery peak 2-12us = 1.84342 mV
  undershoot penalty = 0.863951 mV

40A -> 20A:
  fixed protection is too aggressive
  A2 undershoot penalty = 8.51044 mV
  A4 selects no-op
  A4 recovery peak 2-12us = A0 recovery peak 2-12us = 1.09036 mV

40A -> 1A:
  A4 is no-harm but non-improving under the current guard
  A0/A4 recovery peak 2-12us = 3.61172 mV

120A -> 10A:
  treated as operating-boundary evidence, not improvement evidence
```

Theory revision:

```text
Ton truncation is a partial residual-energy correction.
Pulse inhibit changes the first accepted reentry event and gives the main
medium-drop recovery-peak reduction, but it requires a binding voltage/undershoot
safety projection and a load-drop magnitude selector.
```

Next task: resolve the severe-drop token for `40A -> 1A`, then begin E020 load-rise undershoot validation.
